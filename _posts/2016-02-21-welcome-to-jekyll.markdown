This is the UI project being used for searching ads in [Nirmaan VHL][nirmaan-vhl].

The current pain point is to store the ads related to jobs, admissions, exam notifications, scholarships at a central place and being able to search through them with relative ease.

The solution is to make the counsellors snap a picture of the ads from different sources (newspaper, online etc) and store them in a central DB from which they can be easily queried.


This is the project which is responsible for UI aspects of the `ad search` project.
The API part of `ad search` can be found [here][ad-api]
